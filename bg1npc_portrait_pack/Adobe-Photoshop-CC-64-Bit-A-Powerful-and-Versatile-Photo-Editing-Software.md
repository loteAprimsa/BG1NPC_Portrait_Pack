One of the most useful features of Adobe Photoshop CC 64 bit is the Content-Aware Fill. This feature allows you to remove unwanted objects or areas from your image and fill them with matching pixels from the surrounding area. For example, you can use Content-Aware Fill to remove a person, a sign, or a power line from your photo and make it look like they were never there.
 
To use Content-Aware Fill, you need to select the object or area you want to remove using any selection tool, such as the Lasso Tool or the Quick Selection Tool. Then, go to Edit > Content-Aware Fill. A new window will open, where you can adjust the settings and preview the results. You can also use the Sampling Brush Tool to add or subtract areas from the sample source. When you are satisfied with the outcome, click OK to apply the changes.
 
Another new and improved feature of Adobe Photoshop CC 64 bit is the Object Selection Tool. This tool allows you to quickly and accurately select complex objects in your image, such as animals, people, or vehicles. Unlike the Select Subject feature, which automatically selects the main subject of your image, the Object Selection Tool lets you choose which object you want to select.
 
To use the Object Selection Tool, you need to select it from the toolbar or press W on your keyboard. Then, you can either draw a rectangle or a lasso around the object you want to select. The tool will automatically detect and select the object within the area you drew. You can also refine the selection using the Select and Mask workspace or other selection tools.
